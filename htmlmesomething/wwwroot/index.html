        <img src="images/A-fluffy-cat-looking-funny-surprised-or-concerned.jpg" alt=" Long eared fluffy cat licking lips" width="225" height="225" />
        <p>
            William McMeow comes from a family of mouse ranchers. They have lived in Montana for
            five generations, holding the largest colonies of pure bred white mice. The ranch is extremely
            successful with restaurants seeking their meat as far as London. William, who prefers to be called
            William, is seven years old in people years, enjoys running through fields of long grass,
            catch and release games with the mice he raises, and scratching new couches. He is extremely active
            and prefers to find someone that shares that passion.

        <p>
            Ted is a single dad of an adopted son, Quack. Ted's best friend from high school and his wife died in a tragic
            boating accident. Having no other extended on either side, the child was going to get put into the state
            system. Ted, considering his friend to be family, stepped up and adopted to baby, providing stability to the young
            duck's life. When Ted isn't doing fun activities with his son, you can often find him reading and basking
            on warm windowsills. Just enjoying the quiet for the moment. Ted is five in people years and looking for
            a long term relationship with someone with a heart big enough for him and his son.

        <h4>Our third bachelor is Donnie Apricot</h4>
        <img src="images\derp.jpg" alt="Cat sticking out his tongue" width="250" height="225" />
        <p>
            Donnie is a kind hearted guy that tries hard at everything that he does. Average on looks, his tongue is a wee bit
            too big for his mouth so it sticks out normally but don't let that deter you! He's never afraid to give you a little
            lick to show just how much he cares. Donnie loves to purr, smell the flowers in his garden, and watch the birds from
            the safety of his home. He does have a special diet of only wet cat food. Donnie is six years in human years and
            just looking for someone that loves to cuddle.

        <h4>Our forth bachelor is Keith Purman</h4>
        <img src="images\gentleman.jpg" alt="Cat in a red bowtie" width="250" height="225" />
        <p>
            Keith is a career orientated chap. Currently working in a middle management position, working his way up the corporate
            ladder, Keith is a nice guy. He is a fan of pool and laser tag, playing on the pool league at a local bar. He also is
            a member of the local bird watching club. Keith has described his perfect date as going out to a small quiet bar, getting
            some kibble appetizers and milk espressos while discussing the pros and cons of string, twine, and yarn. Keith is 8 years old
            on the human scale and currently just looking to see what's out there.

        <h4>Our fifth bachelor is Jeff Goldpur</h4>
        <img src="images\naked.jpg" alt="Naked cat sitting like a person" width="250" height="225" />
        <p>
            Jeff is one of those types that always seems angry, commonly called an "RBF", even though he is one of the sweetest cats
            that you will meet. This tends to make him look like a demon spawn to some people, but his heart of gold quickly wins
            over everyone he meets. Jeff is an enthusiastic nudist, also known as a naturalist. He loves to be naked and does so
            whenever he can. Jeff is also an accomplished knitter, making piles of little sweaters to wear on the cold days of winter.
            Jeff is eight years human and looking for his naked soul mate.

        <h4>Our sixth and final bachelor is Wilford Purly</h4>
        <img src="images\older.jpg" alt="Squishy face cat" width="250" height="225" />
        <p>
            Wilford, known by his friends at Willy, is our oldest bachelor at eleven years. He is an established man, with a home
            and life. He is near retirement age so he is looking for someone to enjoy the last few years of their lives together.
            He does have some medical issues but is well educated on his health issues. Willy loves to spend time curled up in
            his favorite armchair, enjoys soft pets to his head, and naps next to the heat vent while it's on. He is looking for
            his forever match.
